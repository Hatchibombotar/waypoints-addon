## How to use
To use it, first craft a waypoint tool by putting a wool block above a stick in a crafting grid.

![waypoint tool recipe](https://github.com/Hatchibombotar/waypoints-addon/raw/master/assets/recipe.png)

Now open the tool menu and click "Add Waypoint".
The waypoint will by default be placed at your position and you can edit it through the popup menu.

Waypoints appear in the world unless you turn them off in "Waypoint Settings" (found in the waypoint tool)

Also in the waypoint tool you will find a waypoint list that allows you to view and edit your waypoints.

## Requirements
- Minecraft 1.21.40 or any newer version.
- No experimental toggles required
